# O-Connor_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary: My project is to create a C++ file that will read in a text file of information of songs with information attached, and be able to group them by genre or by decade released. The idea is to easialy have a group of songs that you can scan to pick the best grouping of tracks that match well together. I am using a data tree to store all the songs as nodes. It groups them alphabetically by taking the asci code of each character in the song.

Group Members: I am working on this project alone.

Known Bugs/Issues: The grouping function for decade and genre are not working yet.
