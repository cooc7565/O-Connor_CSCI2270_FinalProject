# O-Connor_CSCI2270_FinalProject

My project is to create a C++ file that will read in a number of songs and be able to group them by genre or by decade released. The idea is to easialy have a group of songs that you can scan to pick the best grouping of tracks that match well together.

I am working on this project alone.
